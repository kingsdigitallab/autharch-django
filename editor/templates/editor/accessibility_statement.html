        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen;</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard;</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software;</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver).</li>

    <p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="dotted-underline">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>

    <h2>Non accessible content</h2>
    <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

    <h3>Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
    <p>On the form pages, the SiteImprove Accessibility Checker plugin throws the following errors: 'HTML is used to format content' (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="dotted-underline">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> version 2.1 A standard) and 'WAI-ARIA groups are missing names' (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="dotted-underline">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> version 2.1 A standard). Both errors are caused by the third-party plugin, which allows changing content in a rich text editor, and we do not have control over the structure of a rich text editor.</p>
